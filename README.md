## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello and thank you for reading this, welcome to my README, I am a student at the National University of AsunciÃ³n, studying computer engineering.
Since I was a child I enjoyed being in front of a computer and just playing video games, the idea of â€‹â€‹playing with other people who in most cases are not even in your region definitely got me. 
Maybe I'm not the typical profile that starts programming very young and gets into it so soon, but, when I started going to university, I discovered the basic concepts of programming, starting with python, learning to make algorithms, and since I see that you can do things just by typing on the computer and running your program, well at that very moment I feel a connection with this world of programming :heart_eyes:.
I am very interested in how to create servers, manage data, provide security, I hope to find people with the same goals.
I am also open to discovering and learning many things about programming, development and teamwork, so if you have something in mind, don't hesitate and send me a message.
