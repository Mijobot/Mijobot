## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello and thank you for reading this, welcome to my README, I'm a student from the National University of AsunciÃ³n, taking informatic enginering.
Since as a kid I remember enjoying standing in front of a computer and just play videogames, the idea of play with other people that in most cases are not even on your region, definetely caught me. 
Maybe I'm not the tipic profile who starts to coding very young and get in to it so soon, but, when I started to go to the university, I discover the basic concepts of programming, starting with python learning how to make algorithmics, and since I see that you can make things just typing on the computer and running your program, well in that very moment I feel a connection with this programming world :heart_eyes:.
I'm very interesting at how to make servers, manage data, security , and I will practice and get prepared for that, and I hope find people with the same goals.
I'm also open to discover and learn a lot of things of programming, development, and work with a team, so If you have something in mind, dont doubt and please send me a message.
